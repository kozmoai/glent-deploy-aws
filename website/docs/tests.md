# Test Cases

The described test cases below provider a starting point to map the different features and capabilities that needs to be tested when changes occurs. 

------

*This is not intended to be a final or complete list but a starting point to reason about the different use cases and how to test them*

## Assumptions

1. You have GLENT on AWS platform deployed and running.
2. You have several accounts that are used or can be used to provision environments and applications.
3. You have an identity provider configured with backstage(Okta, AD, etc.)

## Test case, context and expected result
We define a context of a test with the letter **"C"**. This will allow us to describe the existing state before we can execute a test case.

We also define test case with the letter **"T"** which describe the set of instructions to test a scenario on GLENT on AWS.

Lastly we define the expected result with the letter **"E"**, this will describe the expected assertion of a resulted test case.
